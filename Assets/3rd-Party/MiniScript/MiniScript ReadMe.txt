Welcome to MiniScript!

MiniScript is a both a scripting language, and an engine for interpreting
that language in your Unity apps.

Everything you need to know is in the Documentation folder.  The following
two files are for people writing MiniScript code; you may distribute these
to your users/players:

• MiniScript-QuickRef.pdf: a one-page summary of the language.

• MiniScript-Manual.pdf: a longer booklet describing the language in more
detail.


But for integrating MiniScript into your own game, the file you need is:

• MiniScript-Integration-Guide.pdf: how to add MiniScript to a Unity game.
